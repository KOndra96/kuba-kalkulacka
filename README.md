# Frontend Mentor - Mortgage repayment calculator

This is my solution of a challenge: [Frontend Mentor - Mortgage Repayment Calculator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/mortgage-repayment-calculator-Galx1LXK73). It's a **LEVEL 2 - JUNIOR** challenge.

**To finish this challenge, I needed to have basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.**

## The users are able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

I'm always happy to receive feedback on my work, so feel free to provide me with any.
